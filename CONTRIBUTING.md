# How to contribute

## Testing, testing and more testing.
This project really needs more testing by more people on more systems.
We do test on Windows and Linux, but the team does not have access to a Mac for testing.

### How to test
1. Grab the latest executable
2. Follow the usage guide, see if the functions work as expected.
3. If you do not use TexTools nor play FFXIV, feel free to create an issue so we can send you some test data.

## Suggest changes (to code, to guidelines or to plans)
We want this project to end up with decent quality, but as inexperienced C# developers it can be hard to keep proper standards up while making the application actually work.

Please suggest changes that would be for the better of the project, code or team!
